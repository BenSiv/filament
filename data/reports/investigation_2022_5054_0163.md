## Deep Dive: North Vancouver John Doe (2022-5054-0163) (Investigated Jan 2026)

### Case Details
*   **Discovery**: April 16/17, 2022
*   **Location**: Capilano River, North Vancouver (near Cleveland Dam) (49.354°N, -123.113°W)
*   **Profile**: Male, 20-30 years old, 5'9", ~190 lbs
*   **Physical**: Black short straight hair, goatee
*   **Clothing**:
    *   White Uniqlo sweater (Size M)
    *   White **Monte Carlo** thermal pants (Size 40)
    *   Jockey underwear (Size L, black)

### Investigation Findings
1.  **Clothing Lead (Monte Carlo Brand)**:
    *   **"Monte Carlo"** is a prominent **Indian clothing brand** based in Ludhiana, Punjab.
    *   It is **not** a standard retailer in Canada (unlike Uniqlo).
    *   It is frequently purchased in India by travelers preparing for cold climates (Canada/UK).
    *   **Inference**: The individual was likely a recent arrival from India (e.g., international student, work permit holder) who brought winter basics from home.

2.  **Missing Persons Checks (Negative)**:
    *   ❌ **Alan James (AJ) Birtwistle** (Missing April 13, 2022): Caucasian, taller (6'0"), curly brown hair. Mismatch.
    *   ❌ **Karanveer Singh** (Missing May 3, 2022): Went missing *after* the body was found.
    *   **No public missing person report** found matching "Male, Asian/Indian, Uniqlo sweater, missing April 2022".

### Recommendations
*   **Targeted Outreach**: Reach out to Indian/Punjabi student associations (e.g., at Capilano University, nearby) regarding a missing male from April 2022.
*   **Media**: Search Punjabi-language media outlets in BC for missing person appeals from Spring 2022 that may not have been picked up by English mainstream news.
