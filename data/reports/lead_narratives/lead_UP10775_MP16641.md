## Investigative Narrative

UP10775 and MP16641 present multiple factual consistencies. Both are Hispanic/Latino males within a compatible age range (UP10775: 25–39 years; MP16641: 25 years at disappearance). The unidentified remains were recovered on 2012-05-12 near the Santa Cruz River, an area consistent with MP16641’s last known location after being seen crossing the US/Mexico border near Nogales on 2010-09-16.

Personal effects show overlap. UP10775 was found with a wallet containing peso and U.S. dollar currency and a paper scrap with a handwritten telephone number. MP16641 was reported to have carried a wallet, currency (dollars or pesos), and telephone numbers, as well as telephone cards.

Clothing details also show partial consistency. Both cases reference a black belt with a silver or white buckle and Nike footwear. UP10775 was wearing Nike Shox athletic shoes (size 9), while MP16641 was reported to have worn Nike athletic shoes (size 11). Differences are noted in shoe size, pants brand and size, and specific garments. Items reported with MP16641, including a backpack and rosary, were not documented with UP10775.

In summary, the geographic location, timeline, demographic profile, and overlapping personal effects support this as a viable investigative lead. Discrepancies in clothing sizes and specific items remain and warrant further investigation.
