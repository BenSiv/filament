## Investigative Narrative
**The Lead**: Peggy Reed was last seen on 3/28/74, but the remains were found on March 1, 78. A 44-year age gap aligns with Peggy's youth (15) at discovery, though her appearance suggests she might have handled large items without assistance. The remains have a color gradient matching Peggy's description of wearing her own shoes and features that suggest she was likely involved in handling the item.

**Fact Alignment**: Peggy's storkbite birthmark and long fingers fit with the remains' pattern. Her age difference aligns with her potential to handle large remains on her own, especially at 15 years old. The remains’ technical features (metal zipper) match Peggy’s identification marks.

**Contradictions & Misalignment**: Peggy was too young for handling a piece of remains by herself, though her appearance suggests otherwise. No contradictions exist; all pieces match Peggy's description. However, the timing is significant as she’d likely handled it without assistance.

**Geography**: Peggy was last seen in 74 near that village, and the remains were found in Livermore much later. The location fits with a plausible mystery spot for handling large items at her age.

**Hypothesis**: Peggy Reed, being too young to handle large remains herself, likely handled the partially decomposed find by herself, especially given her youth and appearance.
