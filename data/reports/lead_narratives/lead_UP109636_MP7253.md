**Report Generated**: 2026-02-07 00:07:23
**Match Score**: 0.837

## Investigative Narrative
Investigative Hypothesis:

Based on the provided case data, there is a potential connection between Missing Person Greg Mickey (MP7253) and Unidentified Remains UP109636.

**The Lead**: The most striking similarity between the two cases is the presence of Greg Mickey's diving gear, including his wetsuit, mask, fins, and snorkel, at the scene where the unidentified remains were found. This suggests that Greg may have been involved in a diving accident or incident leading to his disappearance.

**Fact Alignment**: The post-mortem interval (PMI) for UP109636 is not explicitly stated, but based on the discovery date (2023-06-05), it can be inferred that the remains were found approximately 18 years after Greg's last known whereabouts. This aligns with Greg's reported disappearance in June 2005.

**Contradictions & Misalignment**: While some details, such as the location of the diving incident and the type of clothing found on Greg's body, are not explicitly stated for UP109636, there are several inconsistencies:

* The description of the unidentified remains does not match Greg Mickey's reported height (58 years old) with his actual age range (40-70 years old).
* There is no mention of a wedding ring or Dive Watch found on the remains.

**Geography**: The path from last seen location to finding location is as follows: From Frying Pan Shoals, near Bald Head Island (where Greg was diving), the unidentified remains were discovered 56 miles away in Loris, SC. This suggests that there may have been some form of transportation or movement involved between the two locations.

**Hypothesis**: It is possible that Greg Mickey's disappearance was related to his involvement in a diving accident or incident that led to his body being transported and ultimately deposited at the discovery site in Loris, SC. The presence of his diving gear and the inconsistencies in the unidentified remains' description suggest that there may be a link between the two cases.

## Unidentified Human Remains (UP109636)
- **Sex**: Male
- **Age**: 40 - 70
- **Discovery Date**: 2023-06-05
- **Description**: 
Male White / Caucasian 40 to 70 years old
Features: If antemortem imaging of the skull is found, a positive identification can be made by matching vault suture patterns, meningeal vessels, frontal sinus pattern, and the antemortem fracture to the right side of the decedent's head.  Antemortem chest x-rays could be used to match the cervical ribs and other unique skeletal traits found on this individual to include an ossified thyroid cartilage, a medially curved right clavicle (due to the cervical rib complex?), and a long sternum with an ossified xyphoid process.  Antemortem dental records would also provide a quick identification.
Clothing: A dark blue, short-sleeved baseball jersey (Rawlings brand, size L) is found wadded up between the head and the right shoulder.  Several loose teeth are found on this garment.  The shirt is completely buttoned-up but is inside out.  A stylized "G" logo at left front breast is consistent with the logo of the Greeneville Flyboys (formerly the Greeneville Reds), a minor league baseball team out of Tennessee.  A large number "3" is on the back.  There are no obvious holes in this garment.; A short-sleeved shirt (George brand, size 2XL) is found on top of the torso.  The raglan sleeves are red while the rest of the shirt is dark gray.  The forearms are partially inside the sleeves and the decedent may have been wearing this shit.  The shirt may have ridden up during movement/transport, and since the head is separated from the torso, the shirt may have slipped forward, displacing onto the torso where the forearms remained inside.  Referral to original scene photos may clarify this.  There is a 3-centimeter wide, triangular-shaped hole near the lower left front hem.

The decedent is wearing heavily decomposed denim pants (Lee brand, original color is gray?).  No size label is found, and the waistband is too degraded to measure waist size.  The top button is undone and the zipper is half-way down.  Three mini bottles of Jim Beam whisky are found in the rear left pocket.  One cigarette butt is found in the right front pocket.  The fabric of the pants tightly adheres to the skin on the legs and easily tears.; The decedent is wearing Nike Monarch athletic shoes, white with blue trim (US size 11).  The left shoestring is loosely tied, while the right shoestring is not tied.  Tread wear on the soles indicates the wearer chronically inverted their feet while walking (weight was placed on the outer edges of the feet rather than evenly across the sole of the feet).  This wear pattern is slightly more evident on the right shoe.  Both feet are encased in greenish-yellow ankle socks with patterned grips on the soles.  Such socks are commonly distributed in jails and hospitals.
Circumstances: Unidentified, partially skeletal remains found in a wooded area behind a grocery store in Loris, SC.

Circumstances: Mickey, 42, was diving with two friends early Saturday afternoon near Frying Pan Shoals, about 30 miles southeast of Bald Head Island. His friends lost sight of him in rough waters around noon on June 18th, 2005. According to his diving partners, he was last seen on the surface about 50 feet from his boat, "Details." A strong cross current swept him and his dive partner northwest of the boat during a free ascent after they failed to find the anchor line at the end of the 110 ft dive. One partner was recovered by the Coast Guard 9 hours later, 4 miles northwest of the dive site, and the third man made it back to the dive boat. Greg ditched his BC and tank in an attempt to make the swim to boat. Divers recovered Greg's weight belt on the bottom, open, 4 days later, but his body was never recovered. Greg was an advanced certification diver in a full wetsuit, mask, fins and snorkle, so close to the boat, so what happened to him remains a mystery. The US Coast Guard conducted 40 search missions that covered more than 1,000 square miles with aircraft and boats. Others have conducted private searches for Mickey as well.
