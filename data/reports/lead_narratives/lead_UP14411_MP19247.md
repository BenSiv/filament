## Investigative Narrative
**Investigative Hypothesis**

Based on the provided case data, I propose the following hypothesis:

Oscar Armenta Luque (MP19247) is a potential match for Unidentified Remains UP14411.

**Lead**: The victim's clothing and personal items, including his camouflaged hat, gloves, double socks, and navy thermal shirt, are found at the discovery site. This suggests that the individual may have been wearing these items when he crossed over to the location where his remains were discovered.

**Fact Alignment**:

* Age: Both cases involve a male Hispanic/Latino with an age range of 31-55 years.
* Missing Period vs. Post-Mortem Interval (PMI): The missing period for MP19247 is January 16, 2013, and the PMI for UHR is approximately 8 years (June 13, 2015 - June 13, 2023). While not exact, these timeframes can be reconciled.

**Geography**: Both locations are within a similar geographic area, with MP19247 last seen in an unknown location and UHR found approximately 22 miles away from the initial search area. This proximity suggests that the individual may have been in the same general vicinity.

**Hypothesis**: It is likely that Oscar Armenta Luque crossed over to the discovery site while wearing his personal items, including the camouflaged hat and gloves. The exact circumstances of his death are unknown, but it appears that he may have been intentionally directed or transported to this location. Further investigation is required to confirm the hypothesis and determine the cause and manner of his death.
