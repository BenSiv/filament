## Investigative Narrative
**Investigative Hypothesis**

Based on the provided case data, I propose the following hypothesis:

Roxane Easland (MP28953) is likely connected to Unidentified Remains UP10217.

**The Lead**: Roxane's friend reported her missing under an alias, claiming she had not heard from Karen Lee Baunsgard in over a week. This timeline aligns with the discovery of UHR UP10217 on July 17, 1980, approximately one week after Roxane's disappearance.

**Fact Alignment**:

* Age: Roxane was 23 years old at the time of her disappearance, which matches the estimated age range of UHR UP10217 (16-25 years old).
* Missing period vs. post-mortem interval (PMI): The PMI for UHR UP10217 is not specified, but if we assume a similar timeframe, it's possible that Roxane may have met her fate around the same time as the discovery of UHR.

**Geography**: Both cases originate from Anchorage and involve similar locations, including roads with a high or low profile (e.g., Hansen Road). The proximity of these locations suggests that Roxane's disappearance may be connected to her final resting place.

**Hypothesis**: It is likely that Roxane Easland was in the same vicinity as UHR UP10217 when she went missing, and possibly met her fate nearby. The similarities between their clothing items (e.g., brown leather jacket, boots) further support this connection. Further investigation is required to confirm the exact circumstances of Roxane's disappearance and death.

Recommendations:

* Conduct a thorough analysis of the crime scene and surrounding area for any potential connections or evidence linking Roxane Easland to UHR UP10217.
* Review the original statements from Roxane's friend and other witnesses to gather more information about her disappearance.
* Expand the search for Roxane Easland's personal belongings, including the purse mentioned in the case data.
