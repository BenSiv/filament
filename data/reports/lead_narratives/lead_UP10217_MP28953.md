## Investigative Narrative

UP10217 and MP28953 share significant demographic, geographic, and circumstantial consistencies. Both are White/Caucasian females within a compatible age range (UP10217: 16–25; MP28953: 23 at disappearance). MP28953 was last seen on 1980-06-28 in Anchorage, Alaska, and the unidentified remains were discovered on 1980-07-17 in a wooded area near Eklutna, Alaska, a location associated with known victim recovery sites of serial killer Robert Hansen.

Clothing descriptions show notable overlap. UP10217 was found wearing a brown leather jacket, a light-colored top, jeans, and high-heeled boots. MP28953 was last seen wearing a short brown leather coat with a fur collar, a light-colored top, pants, and high-heeled boots. While there are differences in boot color and outerwear details, the overall clothing profile is consistent.

The primary inconsistency is the estimated postmortem interval. The condition of UP10217 suggests the decedent had been deceased for approximately one year prior to discovery, which does not closely align with MP28953’s disappearance occurring less than one month before the recovery date. This discrepancy introduces uncertainty in the timeline.

Both individuals are believed to be victims of serial killer Robert C. Hansen, who was active in the Anchorage area during this period. In summary, while demographic, clothing, location, and offender-related factors support the investigative lead, the disparity between the postmortem interval and the missing person timeline requires careful consideration and further corroboration.
