## Investigative Narrative
**Investigative Hypothesis**

Based on the provided case data, a potential match exists between Missing Person Roxane Easland (MP28953) and Unidentified Remains UP10217.

**The Lead**: The similarities in circumstances surrounding Ms. Easland's last seen location and the discovery of UHR align with her disappearance. Both cases involve an unknown male encounter on 4th Avenue in downtown Anchorage, approximately two weeks prior to her reported missing by a friend.

**Fact Alignment**: Age: The estimated age range for both Ms. Easland (23-25 years old) and the UHR (16-25 years old) overlap. Missing period vs. post-mortem interval (PMI): The gap between Ms. Easland's last seen date (June 28, 1980) and her reported missing by a friend (July 2, 1980) is consistent with the estimated PMI of UHR (at least one year prior to discovery).

**Contradictions & Misalignment**: No explicit contradictions are found in this analysis. However, it is essential to note that the physical description of Ms. Easland and the UHR differ. The UHR's clothing description includes a light-colored top, jeans, and red knee-high boots, whereas Ms. Easland was last seen wearing a short, brown leather coat with a fur collar.

**Geography**: An analysis of the path from Anchorage to the discovery site is not feasible without further information on the exact locations and routes taken by both individuals. However, it can be noted that the UHR was discovered one mile south of South Eklutna Lake Road near mile post two in Eklutna, Alaska.

**Hypothesis**: Given the similarities in circumstances and age ranges, it is plausible that Ms. Easland's last seen location led to her discovery at the UHR site through an unknown male encounter or subsequent events. The exact sequence of events remains speculative without further investigation.
