## Investigative Narrative
**The Lead**: The connection between MP Dorothy Forstein and UHR UP17721 lies in a striking similarity in their stories: both involve a violent attack on an elderly woman with no apparent motive other than robbery, despite Jules being ruled out as a suspect. Furthermore, both cases feature a description of the victim wearing distinctive clothing items - red slippers in MP's case and gold-trimmed black open-toed slippers in UHR's case.

**Fact Alignment**: 
1. Age: The age range for both MP (40) and UHR (45-60) is relatively close, suggesting a possible connection.
2. Missing Period vs. Post-Mortem Interval (PMI): The discrepancy between the reported 1949 disappearance of MP Forstein and the estimated post-mortem interval of UP17721's body (1972) raises questions.

**Contradictions & Misalignment**:
1. Facial Features: MP's facial features, including her fractured jaw and nose, do not match those described in UHR.
2. Circumstances: The reported circumstances of MP Forstein's disappearance (e.g., returning home with a stranger) differ significantly from the conditions surrounding UHR's body discovery (abandoned burned-out building).
3. Clothing: Although both cases feature distinctive clothing items, they do not match exactly.

**Geography**: 
The geographical path for both cases is uncertain without more information on MP Forstein's last seen location and her potential whereabouts post-disappearance.

**Hypothesis**: Given the inconsistencies between MP Forstein's story and UHR's discovery site, it remains unclear how they were likely connected. It is possible that there may be an unrelated case or person with a similar profile.

## Missing Person (MP35306)
- **Name**: Dorothy Forstein
- **Sex**: Female
- **Age**: 40
- **Last Seen**: 1949-10-14
- **Description**:
Female White / Caucasian 40 years old
Features: - suffered a fractured jaw and nose in January of 1945, evidence still remains in facial expressions.

Clothing: pajamas; red slippers; plain narrow yellow gold wedding band without any inscriptions.
Circumstances: In 1945 Dorothy went shopping. She was seen returning home in the evening, and a neighbor thought "someone was with her, or walking behind her." Dorothy was attacked and nearly beaten to death. They never found who did it; robbery was not a motive, and Jules was ruled out as a suspect.

 Then, in 1950, Jules called his wife to tell him he was going to a political banquet. Dorothy seemed in good spirits. She said, "Don't forget to miss me!" before she hung up. When he returned home later that evening, his wife was gone. The eldest daughter was away from home, but the two younger children were found huddled together in a bedroom. None of Dorothy's personal belongings were missing and the front door was locked.

The older of the two children at home that night (she would have been around 9 years old at that time) said she woke up and went to her mother's room. She saw a man coming up the stairs. She saw her mother lying on the carpet, face down. The man picked up her mother and told the little girl to go back to bed, that her Mommy was sick. She described her mother, who was wearing a red nightgown and red slippers, and the stranger, who was wearing a brown cap and a brown jacket with "something stuck in his shirt." He took the mother downstairs and out the door.

Nothing was disturbed in the house and there weren't any fingerprints.

Dorothy Forstein has never been seen again.
