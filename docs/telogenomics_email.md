# Email Draft: Pitching Telogenomics (TeloDX)

**Subject:** Collaboration Inquiry: Refining Forensic Age Assessment via 3D Telomere Analysis

Hi Telogenomics Team,

My name is Ben Sivan, and I am a Bioinformatician and Data Scientist currently leading **Project Filament**—an initiative focused on improving the identification of unidentified human remains through advanced data integration.

I have been following your work with the **TeloView®** platform and believe there is a unique opportunity to apply your 3D telomere analysis technology to solve a critical bottleneck in forensic investigations: the "Broad Age Interval" gap.

I have attached a short pitch proposal (PDF) outlining how TeloView® could serve as a high-resolution biological clock to refine age assessment in cold cases.

I would love to discuss a potential technical pilot or research collaboration with your team. Are you available for a brief introductory call next week?

Best regards,

**Ben Sivan**
