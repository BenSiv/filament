## Subject: Proposal for Collaboration: Refining Age Assessment in Forensic Cold Cases via TeloView®

Dear Telogenomics Team,

My name is Ben Sivan, and I am a Bioinformatician and Data Scientist with a background in biotechnology and a professional focus on AI-driven knowledge management and genomic selection. I am writing to you regarding **Project Filament**, an initiative I am leading to assist in the identification of unidentified human remains (UHR) through advanced data integration.

### The Challenge: The "Broad Age Interval" Gap
In forensic cold cases, investigators often rely on skeletal and phenotypic data to estimate the age of unidentified individuals. Currently, these estimates frequently result in large intervals (e.g., "Male, 20–40 years old"). This wide search space makes it incredibly difficult to narrow down matches against missing persons databases, where a difference of 5–10 years can be the deciding factor in a successful identification.

### The Project: Filament
Filament is a Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to bridge "hard" forensic facts with unstructured investigative narratives. We use phenotypic probabilities, ancestry estimates, and isotope analysis to create high-accuracy match leads. However, the limitation of current age estimation remains a significant bottleneck.

### The Pitch: TeloView® as a Forensic "Biological Clock"
I have been following your work with the **TeloView®** platform. While your primary focus is on clinical diagnostics for Multiple Myeloma and Alzheimer’s, the precision with which TeloView profiles the 3D organization of telomeres presents a unique opportunity for forensics.

Specifically, I am interested in exploring how TeloView's ability to measure not just telomere length, but also 3D spatial distribution and telomeric aggregates, could be leveraged to:
1. **Normalize biological age estimates** across different tissue types found in remains.
2. **Narrow the age intervals** provided by coroners from decades to years.
3. **Establish a high-resolution "genomic signature" of aging** that can be integrated into Filament's matching engine.

### Proposed Collaboration
I would love to discuss a potential technical pilot or research collaboration where we could explore the application of TeloView in a forensic context. With my focus on scalable bioinformatics pipelines, I believe there is a strong synergy between your cutting-edge structural analysis and Filament's matching framework.

I have attached my professional background for your reference and would welcome the opportunity to pitch this idea to your technical or business development team.

Best regards,

**Ben Sivan**
